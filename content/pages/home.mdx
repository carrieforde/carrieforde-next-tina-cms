My background in business analysis has equipped me with a unique set of skills that allows me to understand the business impact of our features. Before implementation begins, I work with product management to understand the hypothesis (e.g. decrease in drop-off at point x), how we'll be tracking metrics, and the definition of success. Teasing out this information ensures we're tracking feature performance from day one, and helps fight _shiny object syndrome_. ðŸ™ƒ

I currently work at [Freedom Financial Network](https://www.freedomfinancialnetwork.com) where I deliver front end features for [Lendage's](https://lendage.com) platform and consumer experience.
